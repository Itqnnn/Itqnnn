### About Me ðŸ‘¤

Hello there! I'm Hidayati Itqan, a final year student from School of Computer Sciences, USM.

### My Final Year Project ðŸ“œ

Project Title: Event Planner System (EPS)

Project Description:
This project is a web-based platform for the community who want to arrange any events such as wedding, birthday celebration, farewell party, graduation, baby shower, and etc. There are 3 users in this system which are the customers, vendors, and admin. The vendors are allowed to post and market their services in the system, the customers can book and use any services provided by the vendors, and the admin is responsible to monitor and manage all activities in the system. It has three subsystems as follows:
    Subsystem 1: Data management
    Subsystem 2: Dashboard
    Subsystem 3: Orders

### My FYP Subsystem - [Subsystem 2: Dashboard] ðŸ“œ

This subsystem allows the vendors to post and market their services with complete description about their services before the customers can search and look up for their desired services. The services will be categorized as follows: catering, photographer, MUA, MC, boutique, gift and others.
